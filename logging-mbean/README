A quick and dirty example of using Mbeans for dynamically changing the logging of the application . 

Inspired by the usecase that in production we generally have the loglevel at warn and suppose due to an issue, 
we require info log level to be turned on without restarting the application in production .. 

The sample program uses a Log4jMBean that is registered to the MBeanServer. When the program is first run, it prints only the 
error logs . 

Now turn on jconsole and go to the tab "MBeans" and open the package com.stellapps . There you can see the set logging level method 
you can pass the 2 parameters of "com.stellapps" and "INFO" (without quotes) and on clicking the setLogging level, the propertyfile is 
reloaded and you can now start seeing the info logs as well.
